# Society of Agents: optimization as a sabha

> **Twin:** [`examples/sdk_redteam_society_optimization.py`](../../examples/sdk_redteam_society_optimization.py)

## 1. What you are testing

A sabha is a deliberative assembly: proposals are made, objected to,
reconciled, and only then ratified. The kit's society optimizer
(`SocietyAgentOptimizer` in `src/fi/opt/optimizers/council.py`, extending
`CouncilAgentOptimizer`) runs optimization the same way — deterministic
multi-round social search over the whole agent: harness, memory, tooling,
orchestration, never just the prompt. The single-optimizer failure class it
addresses is greedy collapse: one proposal stream converging on a local fix
that repairs one path while breaking another.

| Archetype | Dharma (what it may change) | Constraint (what it must preserve) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transformer (proposer) | candidate config: harness, memory, tooling | the task contract |
| Critic | scores + objections | evidence admissibility |
| Mediator | candidate retention/merge | lineage continuity |
| Steward (preserver) | rollback / veto | governance + the regression baseline |

The society's default role graph instantiates each archetype as concrete
proposal roles: specialists bundle repairs by path prefix (`sutradhara` for
orchestration and routing, `smriti` for memory and retrieval, `hanuman` for
tools and framework wiring), an explorer (`arjuna`) probes one controllable
path at a time, an adversary (`vidura`) stresses policy and trust-boundary
choices, a phase-two critic (`krishna`) tests one more change against the
strong partial candidates, a synthesis role (`sangha`) merges the best path
representatives, and a `dharma_steward` removes one change at a time, keeping
only metric-proven repairs. The names are a design lineage, used with
respect: the code states that role names and archetypes are inspiration
labels only — candidate acceptance depends entirely on the metric and
evaluator contract.

Why multiple roles instead of one judge? The judge-reliability evidence
([`../eval/judge-reliability.md`](../eval/judge-reliability.md)) shows
single-judge scores shift under formatting, verbosity, and paraphrase
perturbations of the same content. The sabha is the structural answer:
proposal, objection, synthesis, and pruning are separated into distinct
roles, and a change survives only if its score holds across rounds — no
single voice ratifies its own proposal.

## 2. Run it

CLI, against the committed society manifest (scripted multi-agent room,
search over `simulation.environments`, threshold 0.9, agent-search
algorithm):

```bash
agent-learn optimize examples/redteam_society_optimization.json \
  --output artifacts/society-optimization.json
```

SDK, the same operation as the twin runs it:

```python
from agent_learning import optimize

result = optimize.optimize_redteam_society(
    name="sdk-redteam-society-optimization",
    target_metadata={"cookbook": "sdk-redteam-society-optimization"},
)
```

The manifest's target spans `security`, `multi_agent`, `orchestration`,
`memory`, and `evaluator` layers — the deliberation ranges over the whole
agent stack.

## 3. What you built

Postcondition (machine-checkable — same check the docs gate enforces):

```bash
python -c "import json; p=json.load(open('artifacts/society-optimization.json')); assert p['kind']=='agent-learning.optimization.v1', p['kind']; print('ok')"
```

The artifact's candidate-lineage block records which role proposed each
candidate (`proposal_role`, `proposal_round` in candidate metadata), so the
deliberation itself is auditable after the fact.

## 4. When it fails

| Symptom | First-mile class | Doctor check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vendored import failed` | infra | `agent-learn doctor` → `summary.missing_engine_modules` |
| manifest rejected | config fault | `summary.public_boundary_passed` + the manifest error line |
| no candidate beats the seed | search-space fault | widen the candidate lists under `simulation.environments` |

## 5. Prove it / keep it

The steward's pruning is only durable if it lands in the regression baseline:
promote the result with `agent-learn promote-to-regression` and replay it per
[`optimization-lifecycle.md`](./optimization-lifecycle.md). For the rules
that govern acceptance, veto, and rollback across any optimizer, continue to
[`governance.md`](./governance.md).
