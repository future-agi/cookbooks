"""Judge-reliability evaluation over scripted judge outputs.

Deterministic, offline, credential-free. A scripted rubric judge (a pure
Python scoring function) scores fixed sample outputs, then the same outputs
are perturbed along three axes — formatting, verbosity, and hardcoded
paraphrase variants (no LLM calls) — and the score deltas across
perturbations are measured and asserted against a tolerance. The artifact is
an `agent-learning.eval.v1` payload whose summary carries the agreement
metrics per axis.
